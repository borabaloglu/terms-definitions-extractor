" Price indices are created to calculate an overall average change in relative prices over time ."	"1"
" 4860 . As we ’ve learned , CPI measures prices as they affect everyday household spending ."	"1"
" Well , a core inflation index is typically calculated by taking the CPI and excluding volatile economic variables ."	"1"

" ( Strictly speaking , AD is what economists call total planned expenditure ."	"0"
" 4926 . U.S. exports will be relatively more expensive , and the quantity of exports sold will fall ."	"0"
" U.S. imports from abroad will be relatively cheaper , so the quantity of imports will rise ."	"0"
" Thus , a higher domestic price level , relative to price levels in other countries , will reduce net export expenditures ."	"0"
" 4929 . In the long run , the most important factor shifting the AS curve is productivity growth ."	"0"
" Productivity means how much output can be produced with a given quantity of labor ."	"1"
" 4932 . When consumers feel more confident about the future of the economy , they tend to consume more ."	"1"
" If business confidence is high , then firms tend to spend more on investment , believing that the future payoff from that investment will be substantial ."	"0"
" Conversely , if consumer or business confidence drops , then consumption and investment spending decline ."	"0"
" 4935 . During a recession , when unemployment is high and many businesses are suffering low profits or even losses , the U.S. Congress often passes tax cuts ."	"0"
" During the recession of 2001 , for example , a tax cut was enacted into law ."	"0"
" Potential GDP can imply different unemployment rates in different economies , depending on the natural rate of unemployment for that economy ."	"1"
" 4944 . Because AD is volatile , it can easily fall ."	"0"
" Thus , even if we start at Yp , if AD falls , then we find ourselves in what Keynes termed a recessionary gap ."	"0"
" The economy is in equilibrium but with less than full employment , as shown at Y1 in the [ link ] ."	"0"
" 4947 . Nondurable goods are things like groceries — once you consume them , they are gone ."	"1"
" Recall from The Macroeconomic Perspective that services are intangible things consumers buy , like healthcare or entertainment . Keynes identified three factors that affect consumption :"	"0"
" 4950 . Just as individuals need to borrow money to purchase homes , so businesses need financing when they purchase big ticket items ."	"0"
" The cost of investment thus includes the interest rate ."	"0"
" Even if the firm has the funds , the interest rate measures the opportunity cost of purchasing business capital ."	"1"
" 4953 . First , aggregate demand is not always automatically high enough to provide firms with an incentive to hire enough workers to reach full employment ."	"0"
" For example , a firm should respond to a decrease in demand for its product by cutting its price to increase sales ."	"0"

" Phillips , an economist at the London School of Economics , was studying the Keynesian analytical framework ."	"0"
" 4962 . The second is changes in people ’s expectations about inflation ."	"0"
" Both factors ( supply shocks and changes in inflationary expectations ) cause the aggregate supply curve , and thus the Phillips curve , to shift ."	"0"
" 4965 . In this situation , unemployment is low , but inflationary rises in the price level are a concern ."	"0"
" The Keynesian response would be contractionary fiscal policy , using tax increases or government spending cuts to shift AD to the left ."	"0"
" The result would be downward pressure on the price level , but very little reduction in output or very little rise in unemployment ."	"0"
" 4971 . Growth in GDP can be explained by increases and investment in physical capital and human capital per person as well as advances in technology ."	"0"
" Physical capital per person refers to the amount and kind of machinery and equipment available to help people get work done ."	"1"
" Compare , for example , your productivity in typing a term paper on a typewriter to working on your laptop with word processing software ."	"0"
" 4983 . If aggregate demand rises rapidly in the neoclassical model , in the long run it leads only to inflationary pressures ."	"0"

" Robert Solow , the Nobel laureate in economics in 1987 , described the dual approach in this way :"	"0"
" 4989 . Economies without money typically engage in the barter system ."	"0"
" Barter — literally trading one good or service for another — is highly inefficient for trying to coordinate the trades in a modern advanced economy ."	"1"
" 4992 . Second , money must serve as a store of value ."	"0"
" In a barter system , we saw the example of the shoemaker trading shoes for accounting services ."	"0"
" So money serves all of these functions — it is a medium of exchange , store of value , unit of account , and standard of deferred payment ."	"1"
" 4998 . As economies grew and became more global in nature , the use of commodity monies became more cumbersome ."	"0"
" Countries moved towards the use of fiat money ."	"0"

" Regulation falls into a number of categories , including reserve requirements , capital requirements , and restrictions on the types of investments banks may make ."	"0"
" In other words , it is a bank ’s net worth ."	"0"
" A bank must have positive net worth ; otherwise it is insolvent or bankrupt , meaning it would not have enough assets to pay back its liabilities ."	"0"
" Depositors racing to the bank to withdraw their deposits , as shown in [ link ] is called a bank run ."	"1"

" [ link ] ( a ) illustrates this situation ."	"0"
" 5058 . [ link ] shows how the Federal Reserve has carried out monetary policy by targeting the federal funds interest rate in the last few decades ."	"0"
" Different episodes of monetary policy during this period are indicated in the figure ."	"0"
" 5061 . Quantitative easing differed from traditional monetary policy in several key ways ."	"0"
" First , it involved the Fed purchasing long term Treasury bonds , rather than short term Treasury bills ."	"1"

" 5127 . In this chapter , we revisit fiscal policy , which was first covered in Welcome to Economics !"	"0"
" Fiscal policy is one of two policy tools for fine tuning the economy ( the other is monetary policy ) ."	"0"
" All government spending and taxes affect the economy , but fiscal policy focuses strictly on the policies of the federal government ."	"0"
" 5130 . Conversely , when the government receives more money in taxes than it spends in a year , it runs a budget surplus ."	"1"
" If government spending and taxes are equal , it is said to have a balanced budget ."	"1"

" The time to get a bill passed is often referred to as the legislative lag ."	"1"
" Finally , once the bill is passed it takes some time for the funds to be dispersed to the appropriate agencies to implement the programs ."	"0"
" 5154 . Also , the government is not a household for many reasons , one of which is that the government has macroeconomic responsibilities ."	"0"
" For example , in 1999 and 2000 , the U.S. government had budget surpluses , although the economy was still experiencing trade deficits ."	"0"
" 5160 . How will this affect interest rates in financial markets ?"	"0"
" However , as the government budget deficit increases , the demand curve for financial capital shifts from D0 to D1 ."	"0"
" However , even a central bank can not erase the overall message of the national savings and investment identity ."	"0"
" The combination of less foreign investment capital and banks that are bankrupt can sharply reduce aggregate demand , which causes a deep recession ."	"0"

" 5274 . The Keynesian cross diagram contains two lines that serve as conceptual guideposts to orient the discussion ."	"0"
" The first is a vertical line showing the level of potential GDP ."	"0"
" 5283 . Imports are 0.1 of real GDP in this example , and the level of imports is calculated in the fifth column ."	"0"
" The final column , aggregate expenditures , sums up C + I + G + X – M ."	"0"
" This aggregate expenditure line is illustrated in [ link ] ."	"0"
" 5286 . In this situation , the level of aggregate expenditure is too low for GDP to reach its full employment level , and unemployment will occur ."	"0"
" The distance between an output level like E0 that is below potential GDP and the level of potential GDP is called a recessionary gap ."	"0"
" 5289 . The familiar demand and supply diagram holds within it the concept of economic efficiency ."	"0"
" One typical way that economists define efficiency is when it is impossible to improve the situation of one party without imposing a cost on another ."	"1"
" 5292 . Remember , the demand curve traces consumers ’ willingness to pay for different quantities ."	"0"
" The amount that individuals would have been willing to pay , minus the amount that they actually paid , is called consumer surplus ."	"1"
" Consumer surplus is the area labeled F — that is , the area above the market price and below the demand curve ."	"0"
" 5295 . First , an inefficient outcome occurs and the total surplus of society is reduced ."	"0"
" The loss in social surplus that occurs when the economy produces at an inefficient quantity is called deadweight loss ."	"1"
" In a very real sense , it is like money thrown away that benefits no one ."	"0"
" 5298 . The demand and supply model emphasizes that prices are not set only by demand or only by supply , but by the interaction between the two ."	"0"
" The answer is that both blades of the demand and supply scissors are always involved ."	"0"
" For example , if a factory produces only 100 cars per year , each car will be quite expensive to make on average ."	"0"
" 4322 . For the United States , this is the Federal Reserve ."	"0"

" In a market economy , decision - making is decentralized ."	"0"
" 4337 . Imports are the goods and services that are produced abroad and then sold domestically ."	"1"
" The size of total production in an economy is measured by the gross domestic product ( GDP ) ."	"1"
" Thus , the ratio of exports divided by GDP measures what share of a country ’s total economic production is sold in other countries ."	"0"
" 4340 . In many cases , it is reasonable to refer to the opportunity cost as the price ."	"0"
" If your cousin buys a new bicycle for $ 300 , then $ 300 measures the amount of “ other consumption ” that he has given up ."	"0"

" 4358 . The third theme is economic efficiency , or getting the most benefit from scarce resources ."	"1"
" 4361 . To find answers to these questions , we need to understand the concept of elasticity ."	"0"
" Elasticity is an economics concept that measures responsiveness of one variable to changes in another variable ."	"1"
" Suppose you drop two items from a second - floor balcony ."	"0"
" 4364 . The price elasticity of demand is the percentage change in the quantity demanded of a good or service divided by the percentage change in the price ."	"1"
" An elastic demand or elastic supply is one in which the elasticity is greater than one , indicating a high responsiveness to changes in price ."	"1"
" 4367 . Elasticities that are less than one indicate low responsiveness to price changes and correspond to inelastic demand or inelastic supply ."	"0"
" Unitary elasticities indicate proportional responsiveness of either demand or supply , as summarized in [ link ] ."	"1"

" Implicit costs are more subtle , but just as important ."	"0"
" They represent the opportunity cost of using resources already owned by the firm ."	"1"
" 4388 . The cost of producing a firm ’s output depends on how much labor and physical capital the firm uses ."	"0"
" A list of the costs involved in producing cars will look very different from the costs involved in producing computer software or haircuts or fast - food meals ."	"0"
" 4391 . Variable costs , on the other hand , are incurred in the act of producing — the more you produce , the greater the variable cost ."	"1"
" Labor is treated as a variable cost , since producing a greater quantity of a good or service typically requires more workers or more work hours ."	"0"
" 4394 . But as output expands still further , the average cost begins to rise ."	"0"
" At the right side of the average cost curve , total costs begin rising more rapidly as diminishing returns kick in ."	"0"

" 4406 . What a buyer pays for a unit of the specific good or service is called price ."	"1"
" The total number of units purchased at that price is called the quantity demanded ."	"1"
" A rise in price of a good or service almost always decreases the quantity demanded of that good or service ."	"0"

" The supply schedule and the supply curve are just two different ways of showing the same information ."	"0"
" At any other price , the quantity demanded does not equal the quantity supplied , so the market is not in equilibrium at that price ."	"0"

" 4451 . A change in any single market is transmitted through these multiple interconnections to other markets ."	"0"
" The vision of the role of flexible prices helping markets to reach equilibrium and linking different markets together helps to explain why price controls can be so counterproductive ."	"0"

" 4505 . Profits for the monopolist , like any firm , will be equal to total revenues minus total costs ."	"0"
" However , because a monopoly faces no competition , its situation and its decision process will differ from that of a perfectly competitive firm ."	"0"
" It is defined as marginal revenue minus marginal cost ."	"0"
" 4511 . What about the vast majority of real world firms and organizations that fall between these extremes , firms that could be described as imperfectly competitive ?"	"0"
" What determines their behavior ?"	"0"
" 4514 . Monopolistic competition involves many firms competing against each other , but selling products that are distinctive in some way ."	"1"
" 4517 . A monopolistically competitive firm perceives a demand for its goods that is an intermediate case between monopoly and competition ."	"1"
" The long - run equilibrium is shown in the figure at point Y , where the firm ’s perceived demand curve touches the average cost curve ."	"0"
" This outcome is why perfect competition displays productive efficiency : goods are being produced at the lowest possible average cost ."	"0"
" 4529 . When firms act together in this way to reduce output and keep prices high , it is called collusion ."	"1"

" 4559 . A natural monopoly poses a difficult challenge for competition policy , because the structure of costs and demand seems to make competition unlikely or costly ."	"0"
" A natural monopoly arises when average costs are declining over the range of production that satisfies market demand ."	"1"
" This typically happens when fixed costs are large relative to variable costs ."	"0"
" This method was known as cost - plus regulation ."	"0"
" The principle that voluntary exchange benefits both buyers and sellers is a fundamental building block of the economic way of thinking ."	"0"
