" There is the same reason , therefore , that the exercise of power , in this case , should be restrained within proper limits , as in that of the state governments ."	"0"
" The experience of the past two centuries has suggested that the Anti - Federalists may have been correct in this regard ; while the states retain a great deal of importance , the scope and powers of the national government are much broader today than in 1787—likely beyond even the imaginings of the Federalists themselves . The struggle to have rights clearly delineated and the decision of the framers to omit a bill of rights nearly derailed the ratification process ."	"0"
" 6068 . In the decades following the Constitution ’s ratification , the Supreme Court declined to expand the Bill of Rights to curb the power of the states , most notably in the 1833 case of Barron v. Baltimore . Barron v. Baltimore , 32 U.S. 243 ( 1833 ) ."	"0"

" This means there has been a process of selective incorporation of the Bill of Rights into the practices of the states ; in other words , the Constitution effectively inserts parts of the Bill of Rights into state laws and constitutions , even though it does n’t do so explicitly ."	"0"
" For example , the courts have permitted religiously inspired blue laws that limit working hours or even shutter businesses on Sunday , the Christian day of rest , because by allowing people to practice their ( Christian ) faith , such rules may help ensure the “ health , safety , recreation , and general well - being ” of citizens ."

" Based in part on the federal RFRA , the Supreme Court agreed 5–4 with Green and Hobby Lobby ’s position and said that Hobby Lobby and other closely held businesses did not have to provide employees free access to emergency contraception or other birth control if doing so would violate the religious beliefs of the business ’ owners , because there were other less restrictive ways the government could ensure access to these services for Hobby Lobby ’s employees ( e.g. , paying for them directly ) ."

" In Schenck v.

" 6110 . Defining obscenity has been something of a challenge for the courts ; Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart famously said of obscenity , having watched pornography in the Supreme Court building , “ I know it when I see it . ”"	"0"
" Into the early twentieth century , written work was frequently banned as being obscene , including works by noted authors such as James Joyce and Henry Miller , although today it is rare for the courts to uphold obscenity charges for written material alone ."	"0"
" In 1973 , the Supreme Court established the Miller test for deciding whether something is obscene : “ ( a ) whether the average person , applying contemporary community standards , would find that the work , taken as a whole , appeals to the prurient interest , ( b ) whether the work depicts or describes , in a patently offensive way , sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law ; and ( c ) whether the work , taken as a whole , lacks serious literary , artistic , political , or scientific value . ”"	"1"

" 6122 . In either case , the amendment indicates that government officials are required to apply for and receive a search warrant prior to a search or seizure ; this warrant is a legal document , signed by a judge , allowing police to search and/or seize persons or property ."	"0"

" For example , we could perhaps see the Second Amendment as standing for the common - law right to self - defense in the home ; the Third Amendment as a statement that government soldiers should not be housed in anyone ’s home ; the Fourth Amendment as setting a high legal standard for allowing agents of the state to intrude on someone ’s home ; and the due process and takings clauses of the Fifth Amendment as applying an equally high legal standard to the government ’s taking a home or property ( reinforced after the Civil War by the Fourteenth Amendment ) ."

" This chapter introduces the macroeconomic model of aggregate supply and aggregate demand , how the two interact to reach a macroeconomic equilibrium , and how shifts in aggregate demand or aggregate supply will affect that equilibrium ."	"0"
" This chapter also relates the model of aggregate supply and aggregate demand to the three goals of economic policy ( growth , unemployment , and inflation ) , and provides a framework for thinking about many of the connections and tradeoffs between these goals ."	"1"
" 4914 . The bottom line remains , however , that every sale represents income to someone , and so , Say ’s law argues , a given value of supply must create an equivalent value of demand somewhere else in the economy ."	"1"
" Because Jean - Baptiste Say , Adam Smith , and other economists writing around the turn of the nineteenth century who discussed this view were known as “ classical ” economists , modern economists who generally subscribe to the Say ’s law view on the importance of supply for determining the size of the macroeconomy are called neoclassical economists ."	"1"
" If supply always creates exactly enough demand at the macroeconomic level , then ( as Say himself recognized ) it is hard to understand why periods of recession and high unemployment should ever occur ."	"0"
" To be sure , even if total supply always creates an equal amount of total demand , the economy could still experience a situation of some firms earning profits while other firms suffer losses ."	"0"
" 4917 . The alternative to Say ’s law , with its emphasis on supply , can be named Keynes ’ law : “ Demand creates its own supply . ”"	"1"
" As a matter of historical accuracy , just as Jean - Baptiste Say never wrote down anything as simpleminded as Say ’s law , John Maynard Keynes never wrote down Keynes ’ law , but the law is a useful simplification that conveys a certain point of view ."	"0"

" This baseline level of unemployment that occurs year - in and year - out is called the natural rate of unemployment and is determined by how well the structures of market and government institutions in the economy lead to a matching of workers and employers in the labor market ."	"1"
" 4941 . Now , focus your attention on the neoclassical zone of the SRAS curve , which is the near - vertical portion on the right - hand side ."	"0"
" If the AD curve crosses this portion of the SRAS curve at an equilibrium point like En where output is at or near potential GDP , then the size of potential GDP pretty much determines the level of output in the economy ."	"0"
" Second , the macroeconomy may adjust only slowly to shifts in aggregate demand because of sticky wages and prices , which are wages and prices that do not respond to decreases or increases in demand ."	"1"
" We will consider these two claims in turn , and then see how they are represented in the AD / AS model . The first building block of the Keynesian diagnosis is that recessions occur when the level of household and business sector demand for goods and services is less than what is produced when labor is fully employed ."	"1"
" 4956 . In fact , if wages and prices were so sticky that they did not fall at all , the aggregate supply curve would be completely flat below potential GDP , as shown in [ link ] ."	"0"
" This outcome is an important example of a macroeconomic externality , where what happens at the macro level is different from and inferior to what happens at the micro level ."	"1"
" In other words , there may be a tradeoff between inflation and unemployment when people expect no inflation , but when they realize inflation is occurring , the tradeoff disappears ."	"0"
" 4968 . The key policy implication is this : Should the government focus more on long - term growth and on controlling inflation than on worrying about recession or cyclical unemployment ?"	"0"
" This focus on long - run growth rather than the short - run fluctuations in the business cycle means that neoclassical economics is more useful for long - run macroeconomic analysis and Keynesian economics is more useful for analyzing the macroeconomic short run ."	"0"
" Let 's consider the two neoclassical building blocks in turn , and how they can be embodied in the aggregate demand / aggregate supply model . The Importance of Potential GDP in the Long Run"	"0"
" 4974 . Keynesian economists argue that if the adjustment from recession to potential GDP takes a very long time , then neoclassical theory may be more hypothetical than practical ."	"0"
" In response to those immortal words of John Maynard Keynes , “ In the long run we are all dead , ” neoclassical economists respond that even if the adjustment takes as long as , say , ten years the neoclassical perspective remains of central importance in understanding the economy ."	"0"
" 4977 . Since the neoclassical economists believe that the economy will correct itself over time , the only advantage of a Keynesian stabilization policy would be to speed up the process and minimize the time that the unemployed are out of work ."	"1"
" Is that the likely outcome?Keynesian macroeconomic policy requires some optimism about the ability of the government to recognize a situation of too little or too much aggregate demand , and to adjust aggregate demand accordingly with the right level of changes in taxes or spending , all enacted in a timely fashion ."	"1"
" After all , neoclassical economists argue , it takes government statisticians months to produce even preliminary estimates of GDP so that politicians know whether a recession is occurring — and those preliminary estimates may be revised substantially later ."	"0"
" 4980 . The macroeconomic equilibrium along the vertical aggregate supply curve can occur at a variety of different price levels , and the natural rate of unemployment can be consistent with all different rates of inflation ."	"0"
" The great economist Milton Friedman ( 1912 – 2006 ) summed up the neoclassical view of the long - term Phillips curve tradeoff in a 1967 speech : “ [ T ] here is always a temporary trade - off between inflation and unemployment ; there is no permanent trade - off . ”"	"0"

" 5004 . For example , M2 includes savings deposits in banks , which are bank accounts on which you can not write a check directly , but from which you can easily withdraw the money at an automatic teller machine or bank ."	"1"
" Many banks and other financial institutions also offer a chance to invest in money market funds , where the deposits of many individual investors are pooled together and invested in a safe way , such as short - term government bonds ."	"1"
" Another ingredient of M2 are the relatively small ( that is , less than about $ 100,000 ) certificates of deposit ( CDs ) or time deposits , which are accounts that the depositor has committed to leaving in the bank for a certain period of time , ranging from a few months to a few years , in exchange for a higher interest rate ."

" 5010 . Banks are a critical intermediary in what is called the payment system , which helps an economy exchange goods and services for money or other financial assets ."	"1"
" Also , those with extra money that they would like to save can store their money in a bank rather than look for an individual that is willing to borrow it from them and then repay them at a later date ."	"0"
" 5013 . Banks are a financial intermediary — that is , an institution that operates between a saver who deposits money in a bank and a borrower who receives a loan from that bank ."	"1"
" Financial intermediaries include other institutions in the financial market such as insurance companies and pension funds , but they will not be included in this discussion because they are not considered to be depository institutions , which are institutions that accept money deposits and then use these to make loans ."

" For banks , the central bank acting as a lender of last resort helps to reinforce the effect of deposit insurance and to reassure bank customers that they will not lose their money ."	"0"
" 5049 .

" 5073 . In the 1970s , when velocity as measured by M1 seemed predictable , a number of economists , led by Nobel laureate Milton Friedman ( 1912 – 2006 ) , argued that the best monetary policy was for the central bank to increase the money supply at a constant growth rate ."	"0"

" 5076 . This vision of focusing monetary policy on a low rate of inflation is so attractive that many countries have rewritten their central banking laws since in the 1990s to have their bank practice inflation targeting , which means that the central bank is legally required to focus primarily on keeping inflation low ."

" For example , from 1994 to 2000 during what was known as the “ dot - com ” boom , the U.S. stock market , which is measured by the Dow Jones Industrial Index ( which includes 30 very large companies from across the U.S. economy ) , nearly tripled in value ."	"1"
" 5082 . At a broader level , some economists worry about a leverage cycle , where “ leverage ” is a term used by financial economists to mean “ borrowing . ” When economic times are good , banks and the financial sector are eager to lend , and people and firms are eager to borrow ."	"1"
" Remember that the amount of money and credit in an economy is determined by a money multiplier — a process of loans being made , money being deposited , and more loans being made ."	"1"
" 5088 . In foreign exchange markets , demand and supply become closely interrelated , because a person or firm who demands one currency must at the same time supply another currency — and vice versa ."	"0"
" To get a sense of this , it is useful to consider four groups of people or firms who participate in the market : ( 1 ) firms that are involved in international trade of goods and services ; ( 2 ) tourists visiting other countries ; ( 3 ) international investors buying ownership ( or part - ownership ) of a foreign firm ; ( 4 ) international investors making financial investments that do not involve ownership ."

" Specifically , you can sign a financial contract and pay a fee that guarantees you a certain exchange rate one year from now — regardless of what the market exchange rate is at that time ."	"0"
" 5094 . When the prices of most goods and services change , the price is said to “ rise ” or “ fall . ” For exchange rates , the terminology is different ."	"0"
" When the exchange rate for a currency rises , so that the currency exchanges for more of other currencies , it is referred to as appreciating or “ strengthening . ” When the exchange rate for a currency falls , so that a currency trades for less of other currencies , it is referred to as depreciating or “ weakening . ”"	"1"
" To illustrate the use of these terms , consider the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar since 1980 , shown in [ link ] ( a ) ."	"0"
" 5100 . The exchange rate that equalizes the prices of internationally traded goods across countries is called the purchasing power parity ( PPP ) exchange rate . A group of economists at the International Comparison Program , run by the World Bank , have calculated the PPP exchange rate for all countries , based on detailed studies of the prices and quantities of internationally tradable goods ."

" As a result , movements in exchange rates can have a powerful effect on incentives to export and import , and thus on aggregate demand in the economy as a whole ."	"0"
" Since the main responsibilities of a central bank are to control the money supply and to ensure that the banking system is stable , a central bank must be concerned about whether large and unexpected exchange rate depreciation will drive most of the country ’s existing banks into bankruptcy ."	"0"
" 5109 . In 2013 , there was a drastic depreciation of the Yen ( relative to the U.S. Dollar ) by about 14 % and again at the end of the year in 2014 also by about 14 % ."	"0"
" 5112 . A soft peg is the name for an exchange rate policy where the government usually allows the exchange rate to be set by the market , but in some cases , especially if the exchange rate seems to be moving rapidly in one direction , the central bank will intervene in the market ."	"1"
" 5115 . Brazil ’s central bank can use a contractionary monetary policy to raise interest rates , which will increase demand and reduce supply of the currency on foreign exchange markets , and lead to an appreciation ."	"0"
" If a central bank ends up in a situation where it is perpetually creating and selling its own currency on foreign exchange markets , it will be buying the currency of other countries , like U.S. dollars or euros , to hold as reserves ."	"0"
" 5121 . Taxes on international capital flows are sometimes known as Tobin taxes , named after James Tobin , the 1981 Nobel laureate in economics who proposed such a tax in a 1972 lecture ."	"1"
" For example , a government might tax all foreign exchange transactions , or attempt to tax short - term portfolio investment while exempting long - term foreign direct investment ."	"0"
" 5124 . A final approach to exchange rate policy is for a nation to choose a common currency shared with one or more nations is also called a merged currency ."	"1"
" While monetary policy is made by policymakers at the Federal Reserve , fiscal policy is made by Congress and the President . The discussion of fiscal policy focuses on how federal government taxing and spending affects aggregate demand ."	"1"
" For example , in 2009 , the U.S. government experienced its largest budget deficit ever , as the federal government spent $ 1.4 trillion more than it collected in taxes ."	"0"
" Although personal income tax revenues account for more total revenue than the payroll tax , nearly three - quarters of households pay more in payroll taxes than in income taxes . The income tax is a progressive tax , which means that the tax rates increase as a household ’s income increases ."	"1"
" The Social Security payroll tax is proportional up to the wage limit , but above that level it becomes a regressive tax , meaning that people with higher incomes pay a smaller share of their income in tax ."	"1"
" 5139 . As a share of GDP , the amount collected by these taxes has stayed nearly constant over time , from about 2 % of GDP in the 1960s to roughly 3 % by 2014 , according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office ."	"0"
" The government also imposes an estate and gift tax on people who pass large amounts of assets to the next generation — either after death or during life in the form of gifts ."	"0"
" 5142 . Graphically , we see that fiscal policy , whether through change in spending or taxes , shifts the aggregate demand outward in the case of expansionary fiscal policy and inward in the case of contractionary fiscal policy ."	"1"
" Changes in tax and spending levels can also occur automatically , due to automatic stabilizers , such as unemployment insurance and food stamps , which are programs that are already laws that stimulate aggregate demand in a recession and hold down aggregate demand in a potentially inflationary boom ."	"1"
" 5148 . Because fiscal policy affects the quantity that the government borrows in financial capital markets , it not only affects aggregate demand — it can also affect interest rates ."	"0"
" In [ link ] , the original equilibrium ( E0 ) in the financial capital market occurs at a quantity of $ 800 billion and an interest rate of 6 % ."	"1"
" The argument of Keynesian macroeconomic policy is that the government needs to lean against the wind , spending when times are hard and saving when times are good , for the sake of the overall economy ."	"1"
" 5157 . The national saving and investment identity must always hold true because , by definition , the quantity supplied and quantity demanded in the financial capital market must always be equal ."	"0"
" However , the formula will look somewhat different if the government budget is in deficit rather than surplus or if the balance of trade is in surplus rather than deficit ."	"0"
" In [ link ] , the original equilibrium ( E0 ) where the demand curve ( D0 ) for financial capital intersects with the supply curve ( S0 ) occurs at an interest rate of 5 % and an equilibrium quantity equal to 20 % of GDP ."	"0"
" 5163 . If the budget deficits are increasing aggregate demand when the economy is already producing near potential GDP , threatening an inflationary increase in price levels , the central bank may react with a contractionary monetary policy ."	"0"
" In this situation , the higher interest rates from the government borrowing would be made even higher by contractionary monetary policy , and the government borrowing might crowd out a great deal of private investment ."	"0"
" On the other hand , if the budget deficits are increasing aggregate demand when the economy is producing substantially less than potential GDP , an inflationary increase in the price level is not much of a danger and the central bank might react with expansionary monetary policy ."	"0"
" In this situation , higher interest rates from government borrowing would be largely offset by lower interest rates from expansionary monetary policy , and there would be little crowding out of private investment ."	"0"
" 5166 . The theory that rational private households might shift their saving to offset government saving or borrowing is known as Ricardian equivalence because the idea has intellectual roots in the writings of the early nineteenth - century economist David Ricardo ( 1772 – 1823 ) ."	"1"
" If Ricardian equivalence holds completely true , then in the national saving and investment identity , any change in budget deficits or budget surpluses would be completely offset by a corresponding change in private saving ."	"0"
" 5169 . First , banks in Turkey borrow in a widely used currency like U.S. dollars or euros , then convert those U.S. dollars to lira , and then lend the money to borrowers in Turkey ."	"0"
" If the value of the lira exchange rate depreciates , then Turkey ’s banks will find it impossible to repay the international loans that are in U.S. dollars or euros ."	"0"
" Many countries around the world have experienced this kind of recession in recent years : along with Turkey in 2002 , this general pattern was followed by Mexico in 1995 , Thailand and countries across East Asia in 1997 – 1998 , Russia in 1998 , and Argentina in 2002 ."	"0"
" 5175 . The world ’s great economic success stories in the last few decades began in the 1970s with that group of nations sometimes known as the East Asian Tigers : South Korea , Thailand , Malaysia , Indonesia , and Singapore ."	"1"
" The monetary policy prescription for dealing with recession is straightforward : run an expansionary monetary policy to increase the quantity of money and loans , drive down interest rates , and increase aggregate demand ."	"0"
" 5181 . In a recession , there is usually relatively little danger of inflation taking off , and so even a central bank , with fighting inflation as its top priority , can usually justify some reduction in interest rates . With regard to fiscal policy , the automatic stabilizers discussed in Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy should be allowed to work , even if this means larger budget deficits in times of recession ."	"0"
" There is less agreement over whether , in addition to automatic stabilizers , governments in a recession should try to adopt discretionary fiscal policy of additional tax cuts or spending increases ."	"0"
" In the case of the Great Recession , the case for this kind of extra - aggressive expansionary fiscal policy is stronger , but for a smaller recession , given the time lags of implementing fiscal policy , discretionary fiscal policy should be used with caution ."	"0"
" 5184 . Likewise , interest rates that are not indexed mean that the lenders of money will be paid back in devalued currency and will also lose purchasing power on monies that were lent ."	"0"
" It is clearly possible — and perhaps sometimes necessary — for a converging economy ( the economy of a country that demonstrates the ability to catch up to the technology leaders ) to live with a degree of uncertainty over inflation that would be politically unacceptable in the high - income economies ."	"1"
" In order for a trade deficit to take place , foreign countries must provide loans or investments , which they are willing to do because they expect they will be repaid eventually ( that the deficit will become a surplus ) ."	"0"
" The result could be a burst of inflation and , if the Federal Reserve were to run a tight monetary policy to reduce the inflation , it could also lead to recession ."	"0"
" 5196 . Recall from the chapter Choice in a World of Scarcity that a country has a comparative advantage when a good can be produced at a lower cost in terms of other goods ."	"0"
" Given their current production levels , if the United States can trade an amount of corn fewer than 60 bushels and receives in exchange an amount of oil greater than 20 barrels , it will gain from trade ."	"0"
" Thus , if Mexico can export no more than 2,000 pairs of shoes ( giving up 2,000 pairs of shoes ) in exchange for imports of at least 2,500 refrigerators ( a gain of 2,500 refrigerators ) , it will be able to consume more of both goods than before trade ."	"0"
" 5205 . What can be the economic benefit of having workers of fairly similar skills making cars , computers , machinery and other products which are then shipped across the oceans to and from the United States , the European Union , and Japan ?"	"0"
" There are two reasons : ( 1 ) The division of labor leads to learning , innovation , and unique skills ; and ( 2 ) economies of scale ."	"0"
" The concept of economies of scale , as introduced in Cost and Industry Structure , means that as the scale of output goes up , average costs of production decline — at least up to a point ."	"1"
" This agreement has since been superseded by the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , whose membership includes about 150 nations and most of the economies of the world ."	"0"
" 5223 . Even when their climate and land are well - suited to products like cotton , rice , sugar , or milk , farmers in low - income countries find it difficult to compete ."	"0"
" 5229 . One concern is that while globalization may be benefiting high - skilled , high - wage workers in the United States , it may also impose costs on low - skilled , low - wage workers ."	"0"
" After all , high - skilled U.S. workers presumably benefit from increased sales of sophisticated products like computers , machinery , and pharmaceuticals in which the United States has a comparative advantage ."	"0"
" 5232 . However , Bhutanese politicians , business leaders , and workers hope that if the local industry had a chance to get established , before it needed to face international competition , then a domestic company or group of companies could develop the skills , management , technology , and economies of scale that it needs to become a successful profit - earning domestic industry ."

" Thus , the infant industry argument for protectionism is to block imports for a limited time , to give the infant industry time to mature , before it starts competing on equal terms in the global economy ."	"1"
" 5235 . Anti - dumping laws block imports that are sold below the cost of production by imposing tariffs that increase the price of these imports to reflect their cost of production ."	"1"
" Since dumping is not allowed under the rules of the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , nations that believe they are on the receiving end of dumped goods can file a complaint with the WTO ."	"0"
" Anti - dumping complaints have risen in recent years , from about 100 cases per year in the late 1980s to about 200 new cases each year by the late 2000s ."	"0"
" 5238 . In general , high - income countries such as the United States , Canada , Japan , and the nations of the European Union have relatively strict environmental standards ."	"0"
" The general view of the governments of such countries is that environmental protection is a luxury : as soon as their people have enough to eat , decent healthcare , and longer life expectancies , then they will spend more money on sewage treatment plants , scrubbers to reduce air pollution from factory smokestacks , national parks to protect wildlife , and so on ."

" 5247 . In other words , the economic analysis of free trade does not rely on a belief that foreign trade is not disruptive or does not pose tradeoffs ; indeed , the story of Technotron begins with a particular disruptive market change — a new technology — that causes real tradeoffs ."	"0"
" In thinking about the disruptions of foreign trade , or any of the other possible costs and tradeoffs of foreign trade discussed in this chapter , the best public policy solutions typically do not involve protectionism , but instead involve finding ways for public policy to address the particular issues , while still allowing the benefits of international trade to occur ."

" The opening sentence of his book , The Theory of Moral Sentiments , puts it very clearly : “ How selfish soever man may be supposed , there are evidently some principles in his nature , which interest him in the fortune of others , and render their happiness necessary to him , though he derives nothing from it except the pleasure of seeing it . ”"	"0"
" All choices on the production possibilities frontier show productive efficiency because in such cases , there is no way to increase the quantity of one good without decreasing the quantity of the other ."	"0"
" The price elasticity of supply is the percentage change in quantity supplied divided by the percentage change in price . Elasticities can be usefully divided into three broad categories : elastic , inelastic , and unitary ."	"1"
" 4370 . Infinite elasticity or perfect elasticity refers to the extreme case where either the quantity demanded ( Qd ) or supplied ( Qs ) changes by an infinite amount in response to any change in price at all ."	"1"
" 4373 . Constant unitary elasticity , in either a supply or demand curve , occurs when a price change of one percent results in a quantity change of one percent ."	"1"
" For most products , most of the time , the income elasticity of demand is positive : that is , a rise in income will cause an increase in the quantity demanded ."	"1"
" However , for a few goods , an increase in income means that one might purchase less of the good ; for example , those with a higher income might buy fewer hamburgers , because they are buying more steak instead , or those with a higher income might buy less cheap wine and more imported beer ."

" 4487 . Entry and exit to and from the market are the driving forces behind a process that , in the long run , pushes the price down to minimum average total costs so that all firms are earning a zero profit .

" 4532 . Because of the complexity of oligopoly , which is the result of mutual interdependence among firms , there is no single , generally - accepted theory of how oligopolies behave , in the same way that we have theories for all the other market structures ."	"1"
" Instead , economists use game theory , a branch of mathematics that analyzes situations in which players must make decisions and then receive payoffs based on what other players decide to do ."	"1"
" 4535 . The result of this prisoner ’s dilemma is often that even though A and B could make the highest combined profits by cooperating in producing a lower level of output and acting like a monopolist , the two firms may well end up in a situation where they each increase output and earn only $ 400 each in profits ."

" 4547 . An early tool was the concentration ratio , which measures what share of the total sales in the industry are accounted for by the largest firms , typically the top four to eight firms ."	"1"
" For an explanation of how high market concentrations can create inefficiencies in an economy , refer to Monopoly . Say that the market for replacing broken automobile windshields in a certain city has 18 firms with the market shares shown in [ link ] , where the market share is each firm ’s proportion of total sales in that market ."

" A narrowly defined market will tend to make concentration appear higher , while a broadly defined market will tend to make it appear smaller . There are two especially important shifts affecting how markets are defined in recent decades : one centers on technology and the other centers on globalization ."	"1"
" 4553 . Antitrust law includes rules against restrictive practices — practices that do not involve outright agreements to raise price or to reduce the quantity produced , but that might have the effect of reducing competition ."	"1"
" Antitrust cases involving restrictive practices are often controversial , because they delve into specific contracts or agreements between firms that are allowed in some cases but not in others ."	"0"
" For example , if a product manufacturer is selling to a group of dealers who then sell to the general public it is illegal for the manufacturer to demand a minimum resale price maintenance agreement , which would require the dealers to sell for at least a certain minimum price ."	"1"

" If the firm is required to pay $ 100 for the additional external costs of pollution each time it produces a refrigerator , production becomes more costly and the entire supply curve shifts up by $ 100 ."	"0"
" These types of laws , which specify allowable quantities of pollution and which also may detail which pollution - control technologies must be used , fall under the category of command - and - control regulation ."	"0"

" Thus , while the availability of the factors of production determines a nation ’s potential GDP , the amount of goods and services actually being sold , known as real GDP , depends on how much demand exists across the economy ."	"1"
" The Keynesian AD / AS ModelThe Keynesian View of the AD / AS Model uses an SRAS curve , which is horizontal at levels of output below potential and vertical at potential output ."	"0"
" The key policy implication for either situation is that government needs to step in and close the gap , increasing spending during recessions and decreasing spending during booms to return aggregate demand to match potential output . Recall from The Aggregate Supply - Aggregate Demand Model that aggregate demand is total spending , economy - wide , on domestic goods and services ."	"1"
" Investment falls into four categories : producer ’s durable equipment and software , new nonresidential structures ( such as factories , offices , and retail locations ) , changes in inventories , and residential structures ( such as single - family homes , townhouses , and apartment buildings ) ."

" The size of the multiplier is critical and was a key element in recent discussions of the effectiveness of the Obama administration ’s fiscal stimulus package , officially titled the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 ."	"0"
" These suggestions were slightly tongue - in - cheek , but their purpose was to emphasize that a Great Depression is no time to quibble over the specifics of government spending programs and tax cuts when the goal should be to pump up aggregate demand by enough to lift the economy to potential GDP ."	"0"
" 4967 . The neoclassical perspective on macroeconomics holds that , in the long run , the economy will fluctuate around its potential GDP and its natural rate of unemployment ."	"0"
" This chapter begins with two building blocks of neoclassical economics : ( 1 ) the size of the economy is determined by potential GDP , and ( 2 ) wages and prices will adjust in a flexible manner so that the economy will adjust back to its potential GDP level of output ."	"0"
" 4973 . Neoclassical economists who focus on potential GDP as the primary determinant of real GDP argue that the long - run aggregate supply curve is located at potential GDP — that is , the long - run aggregate supply curve is a vertical line drawn at the level of potential GDP , as shown in [ link ] ."	"0"
" A vertical LRAS curve means that the level of aggregate supply ( or potential GDP ) will determine the real GDP of the economy , regardless of the level of aggregate demand ."	"0"
" Over time , increases in the quantity and quality of physical capital , increases in human capital , and technological advancements shift potential GDP and the vertical LRAS curve gradually to the right ."	"0"
" 4976 . After all , many people and firms are not especially well informed , either about what is happening in the economy or about how the economy works ."	"0"
" An alternate assumption is that people and firms act with adaptive expectations : they look at past experience and gradually adapt their beliefs and behavior as circumstances change , but are not perfect synthesizers of information and accurate predictors of the future in the sense of rational expectations theory ."	"1"
" If most people and businesses have some form of adaptive expectations , then the adjustment from the short run and long run will be traced out in incremental steps that occur over time . The empirical evidence on the speed of macroeconomic adjustment of prices and wages is not clear - cut ."	"0"
" The short run upward sloping aggregate supply curve implies a downward sloping Phillips curve ; thus , there is a tradeoff between inflation and unemployment in the short run ."	"0"
" 4982 . Neoclassical economists will not tend to see aggregate demand as a useful tool for reducing unemployment ; after all , if economic output is determined by a vertical aggregate supply curve , then aggregate demand has no long - run effect on unemployment ."	"0"
" Instead , neoclassical economists believe that aggregate demand should be allowed to expand only to match the gradual shifts of aggregate supply to the right — keeping the price level much the same and inflationary pressures low ."	"0"
" Nor is the neoclassical model especially helpful when the economy is mired in an especially deep and long - lasting recession , like the Great Depression of the 1930s ."	"0"
" Keynesian economics tends to view inflation as a price that might sometimes be paid for lower unemployment ; neoclassical economics tends to view inflation as a cost that offers no offsetting gains in terms of lower unemployment ."	"0"
" You should also understand Keynesian and neoclassical frameworks for macroeconomic analysis and how these frameworks can be embodied in the aggregate demand / aggregate supply ( AD / AS ) model ."	"0"
" With the goals and frameworks for macroeconomic analysis in mind , the final step is to discuss the two main categories of macroeconomic policy : monetary policy , which focuses on money , banking and interest rates ; and fiscal policy , which focuses on government spending , taxes , and borrowing ."	"1"
" The Federal Reserve Bank , which is the central bank of the United States , is a bank regulator and is responsible for monetary policy and defines money according to its liquidity ."	"1"
" For example , M2 includes savings deposits in banks , which are bank accounts on which you can not write a check directly , but from which you can easily withdraw the money at an automatic teller machine or bank ."	"1"
" Many banks and other financial institutions also offer a chance to invest in money market funds , where the deposits of many individual investors are pooled together and invested in a safe way , such as short - term government bonds ."	"0"
" A debit card , like a check , is an instruction to the user ’s bank to transfer money directly and immediately from your bank account to the seller ."	"1"
" 5009 . One key message underlying this discussion of M1 and M2 is that money in a modern economy is not just paper bills and coins ; instead , money is closely linked to bank accounts ."	"0"
" Banks are a financial intermediary — that is , an institution that operates between a saver who deposits money in a bank and a borrower who receives a loan from that bank ."	"1"
" Financial intermediaries include other institutions in the financial market such as insurance companies and pension funds , but they will not be included in this discussion because they are not considered to be depository institutions , which are institutions that accept money deposits and then use these to make loans ."	"0"
" 5021 . Many banks issue home loans , and charge various handling and processing fees for doing so , but then sell the loans to other banks or financial institutions who collect the loan payments ."	"0"
" The market where loans are made to borrowers is called the primary loan market , while the market in which these loans are bought and sold by financial institutions is the secondary loan market ."	"1"
" One key factor that affects what financial institutions are willing to pay for a loan , when they buy it in the secondary loan market , is the perceived riskiness of the loan : that is , given the characteristics of the borrower , such as income level and whether the local economy is performing strongly , what proportion of loans of this type will be repaid ?"	"1"
" If a bank makes most of its loans in a local area , then the bank may be financially vulnerable if the local economy declines , so that many people are unable to make their payments ."	"0"
" 5027 . Clearly , the bank can not survive in the long term if it is paying out more in interest to depositors than it is receiving from borrowers ."	"0"
" For example , suppose a bank specialized in lending to a niche market — say , making a high proportion of its loans to construction companies that build offices in one downtown area ."	"0"
" They are allowed to purchase U.S. Treasury securities but , to protect depositors , they are not permitted to invest in the stock market or other assets that are perceived as too risky ."	"0"
" As discussed in Money and Banking , a bank ’s assets are its loans , and the value of these assets depends on estimates about the risk that these loans will not be repaid ."	"1"
" These issues can become even more complex when a bank makes loans to banks or firms in other countries , or arranges financial deals that are much more complex than a basic loan ."	"0"
" The political question arises because the decision by a bank supervisor to require a bank to close or to change its financial investments is often controversial , and the bank supervisor often comes under political pressure from the owners of the bank and the local politicians to keep quiet and back off ."	"0"
" Open market operations take place when the central bank sells or buys U.S. Treasury bonds in order to influence the quantity of bank reserves and the level of interest rates ."	"1"
" 5048 . A second method of conducting monetary policy is for the central bank to raise or lower the reserve requirement , which , as we noted earlier , is the percentage of each bank ’s deposits that it is legally required to hold either as cash in their vault or on deposit with the central bank ."	"1"
" 5054 . Of course , financial markets display a wide range of interest rates , representing borrowers with different risk premiums and loans that are to be repaid over different periods of time ."	"0"
" In general , when the federal funds rate drops substantially , other interest rates drop , too , and when the federal funds rate rises , other interest rates rise ."	"0"
" A contractionary monetary policy will raise interest rates , discourage borrowing for investment and consumption spending , and cause the original demand curve ( AD0 ) to shift left to AD1 , so that the new equilibrium ( E1 ) occurs at the potential GDP level of 700.These examples suggest that monetary policy should be countercyclical ; that is , it should act to counterbalance the business cycles of economic downturns and upswings ."	"1"
" 5063 . Banks are legally required to hold a minimum level of reserves , but no rule prohibits them from holding additional excess reserves above the legally mandated limit ."	"0"
" For example , during a recession banks may be hesitant to lend , because they fear that when the economy is contracting , a high proportion of loan applicants become less likely to repay their loans ."	"0"
" If the nominal interest rate is 7 % and the rate of inflation is 3 % , then the borrower is effectively paying a 4 % real interest rate ."	"0"
" 5072 . So far at least , it has proven difficult to draw clear links between these kinds of factors and the specific up - and - down fluctuations in M1 ."	"0"
" 5075 . In the neoclassical model , the level of potential GDP ( and the natural rate of unemployment that exists when the economy is producing at potential GDP ) is determined by real economic factors ."	"0"
" If the original level of aggregate demand is AD0 , then an expansionary monetary policy that shifts aggregate demand to AD1 only creates an inflationary increase in the price level , but it does not alter GDP or unemployment ."	"0"
" From this perspective , all that monetary policy can do is to lead to low inflation or high inflation — and low inflation provides a better climate for a healthy and growing economy ."	"0"
" For those who subscribe to the inflation targeting philosophy , the fear is that politicians who are worried about slow economic growth and unemployment will constantly pressure the central bank to conduct a loose monetary policy — even if the economy is already producing at potential GDP ."	"0"
" In some countries , the central bank may lack the political power to resist such pressures , with the result of higher inflation , but no long - term reduction in unemployment ."	"0"
" 5081 . At a broader level , some economists worry about a leverage cycle , where “ leverage ” is a term used by financial economists to mean “ borrowing . ”"	"1"
" Remember that the amount of money and credit in an economy is determined by a money multiplier — a process of loans being made , money being deposited , and more loans being made ."	"1"
" An exchange rate is nothing more than a price — that is , the price of one currency in terms of another currency — and so they can be analyzed with the tools of supply and demand ."	"1"
" The first module of this chapter begins with an overview of foreign exchange markets : their size , their main participants , and the vocabulary for discussing movements of exchange rates ."	"0"
" In The International Trade and Capital Flows , for example , we discussed how exchange rates are used to compare GDP statistics from countries where GDP is measured in different currencies ."	"0"
" The demand curve ( D ) for Mexican pesos intersects with the supply curve ( S ) of Mexican pesos at the equilibrium point ( E ) , which is an exchange rate of 10 cents in U.S. currency for each Mexican peso and a total volume of 85 billion pesos ."	"0"
" 5099 . If the price of cars was much higher than $ 32,000 in this example , then at least some Canadian buyers would convert their Canadian dollars to U.S. dollars and go to the United States to purchase their cars ."	"0"
" It may occur slowly , but over time , it will force prices and exchange rates to align so that the price of internationally traded goods is similar in all countries ."	"0"
" 5102 . A central bank will be concerned about the exchange rate for multiple reasons : ( 1 ) Movements in the exchange rate will affect the quantity of aggregate demand in an economy ; ( 2 ) frequent substantial fluctuations in the exchange rate can disrupt international trade and cause problems in a nation ’s banking system – this may contribute to an unsustainable balance of trade and large inflows of international financial capital , which can set the economy up for a deep recession if international investors decide to move their money to another country ."	"0"
" 5105 . In 1997 – 1998 , countries across eastern Asia , like Thailand , Korea , Malaysia , and Indonesia , experienced a sharp depreciation of their currencies , in some cases 50 % or more ."	"0"
" 5111 . When a government intervenes in the foreign exchange market so that the exchange rate of its currency is different from what the market would have produced , it is said to have established a “ peg ” for its currency ."	"1"
" A soft peg is the name for an exchange rate policy where the government usually allows the exchange rate to be set by the market , but in some cases , especially if the exchange rate seems to be moving rapidly in one direction , the central bank will intervene in the market ."	"1"
" 5114 . The central bank can expand the money supply by creating reals , use the reals to purchase foreign currencies , and avoid selling any of its own currency ."	"0"
" 5117 . For example , when a country pegs its exchange rate , it will sometimes face economic situations where it would like to have an expansionary monetary policy to fight recession — but it can not do so because that policy would depreciate its exchange rate and break its hard peg ."	"0"
" With a soft peg exchange rate policy , the central bank can sometimes ignore the exchange rate and focus on domestic inflation or recession — but in other cases the central bank may ignore inflation or recession and instead focus on its soft peg exchange rate ."	"0"
" With a hard peg policy , domestic monetary policy is effectively no longer determined by domestic inflation or unemployment , but only by what monetary policy is needed to keep the exchange rate at the hard peg ."	"0"
" 5120 . Thus , even though the goal of a soft peg policy is to reduce short - term fluctuations of the exchange rate , the existence of the policy — when anticipated in the foreign exchange market — may sometimes increase short - term fluctuations as international investors try to anticipate how and when the central bank will act ."	"0"
" While monetary policy is made by policymakers at the Federal Reserve , fiscal policy is made by Congress and the President . The discussion of fiscal policy focuses on how federal government taxing and spending affects aggregate demand ."	"0"
" 5132 . When most people think of taxes levied by the federal government , the first tax that comes to mind is the individual income tax that is due every year on April 15 ( or the first business day after ) ."	"0"
" The second largest source of federal revenue is the payroll tax ( captured in social insurance and retirement receipts ) , which provides funds for Social Security and Medicare ."	"0"
" The Social Security payroll tax is proportional up to the wage limit , but above that level it becomes a regressive tax , meaning that people with higher incomes pay a smaller share of their income in tax ."	"1"
" As a share of GDP , the amount collected by these taxes has stayed nearly constant over time , from about 2 % of GDP in the 1960s to roughly 3 % by 2014 , according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office ."	"0"
" The national debt refers to the total amount that the government has borrowed over time ; in contrast , the budget deficit refers to how much has been borrowed in one particular year ."	"1"
" 5147 . In the early 1960s , many leading economists believed that the problem of the business cycle , and the swings between cyclical unemployment and inflation , were a thing of the past ."	"0"
" On the cover of its December 31 , 1965 , issue , Time magazine , then the premier news magazine in the United States , ran a picture of John Maynard Keynes , and the story inside identified Keynesian theories as “ the prime influence on the world ’s economies . ”"	"0"
" The article reported that policymakers have “ used Keynesian principles not only to avoid the violent [ business ] cycles of prewar days but to produce phenomenal economic growth and to achieve remarkably stable prices . ”"	"0"
" The U.S. economy suffered one recession from December 1969 to November 1970 , a deeper recession from November 1973 to March 1975 , and then double - dip recessions from January to June 1980 and from July 1981 to November 1982 ."	"0"
" 5150 . It often takes some months before the economic statistics signal clearly that a downturn has started , and a few months more to confirm that it is truly a recession and not just a one- or two - month blip ."	"0"
" 5156 . The national saving and investment identity , first introduced in The International Trade and Capital Flows chapter , provides a framework for showing the relationships between the sources of demand and supply in financial capital markets ."	"0"
" The identity begins with a statement that must always hold true : the quantity of financial capital supplied in the market must equal the quantity of financial capital demanded ."	"0"
" If the budget deficits are increasing aggregate demand when the economy is already producing near potential GDP , threatening an inflationary increase in price levels , the central bank may react with a contractionary monetary policy ."	"0"
" In this situation , the higher interest rates from the government borrowing would be made even higher by contractionary monetary policy , and the government borrowing might crowd out a great deal of private investment ."	"0"
" On the other hand , if the budget deficits are increasing aggregate demand when the economy is producing substantially less than potential GDP , an inflationary increase in the price level is not much of a danger and the central bank might react with expansionary monetary policy ."	"0"
" 5165 . Not all spending on educational human capital needs to happen through the government : many college students in the United States pay a substantial share of the cost of their education ."	"0"
" If low - income countries of the world are going to experience a widespread increase in their education levels for grade - school children , government spending seems likely to play a substantial role ."	"0"
" At the original equilibrium ( E0 ) , where the demand for U.S. dollars ( D0 ) intersects with the supply of U.S. dollars ( S0 ) on the foreign exchange market , the exchange rate is 0.9 euros per U.S. dollar and the equilibrium quantity traded in the market is $ 100 billion per day ( which was roughly the quantity of dollar – euro trading in exchange rate markets in the mid- 2000s ) ."

" Purchasing power parity , as formally defined in Exchange Rates and International Capital Flows , takes into account the fact that prices of the same good are different across countries ."	"0"
" The Macroeconomic Perspective explained how to measure GDP , the challenges of using GDP to compare standards of living , and the difficulty of confusing economic size with distribution ."	"0"
" Recent research by two MIT economists , Abhijit Bannerjee and Esther Duflo , has confirmed that the households in these economies are trapped in low incomes because they can not muster enough investment to push themselves out of poverty ."	"0"
" According to data collected by the Central Intelligence Agency in its CIA Factbook , as of 2013 , 90 % of Burundi ’s population is agrarian , with coffee and tea as the main income producing crop ."	"0"
" 5180 . The monetary policy prescription for dealing with recession is straightforward : run an expansionary monetary policy to increase the quantity of money and loans , drive down interest rates , and increase aggregate demand ."	"0"
" In a recession , there is usually relatively little danger of inflation taking off , and so even a central bank , with fighting inflation as its top priority , can usually justify some reduction in interest rates ."	"0"
" With regard to fiscal policy , the automatic stabilizers discussed in Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy should be allowed to work , even if this means larger budget deficits in times of recession ."	"0"
" There is less agreement over whether , in addition to automatic stabilizers , governments in a recession should try to adopt discretionary fiscal policy of additional tax cuts or spending increases ."	"0"
" First , whatever happens with aggregate supply and aggregate demand in the short run , monetary policy can be used to prevent inflation from becoming entrenched in the economy in the medium and long term ."	"0"
" 5186 . There is a long list of worries about foreign trade in goods and services : fear of job loss , environmental dangers , unfair labor practices , and many other concerns ."	"0"
" These arguments are discussed at some length in The International Trade and Capital Flows . Of all of the arguments for limitations on trade , perhaps the most controversial one among economists is the infant industry argument ; that is , subsidizing or protecting new industries for a time until they become established ."	"1"
" Over that time , global exports as a share of global GDP rose from less than 1 % of GDP in 1820 to 9 % of GDP in 1913 ."	"0"
" Recall from Choice in a World of Scarcity that the production possibilities frontier shows the maximum amount that each country can produce given its limited resources , in this case workers , and its level of technology ."	"0"
" A high proportion of trade , however , is intra - industry trade — that is , trade of goods within the same industry from one country to another ."	"1"
" As indicated in the beginning of the chapter , the production of the iPhone involves the design and engineering of the phone in the United States , parts supplied from Korea , the assembly of the parts in China , and the advertising and marketing done in the United States ."	"0"
" 5216 . Nontariff barriers are all the other ways that a nation can draw up rules , regulations , inspections , and paperwork to make it more costly or difficult to import products ."	"1"
" 5219 . The extra 15 tons of sugar production , shown by the horizontal gap between the demand curve and the supply curve in Brazil , is exported to the United States ."	"0"
" Even when their climate and land are well - suited to products like cotton , rice , sugar , or milk , farmers in low - income countries find it difficult to compete ."	"0"
" The effects of a tariff on producers and consumers in the United States can be measured using two concepts developed in Demand , Supply , and Efficiency : consumer surplus and producer surplus ."	"0"
" This is why the United States International Trade Commission , in its study of barriers to trade , predicts that reducing trade barriers would not lead to an overall loss of jobs ."	"0"
" For example , in the United States , the minimum wage is $ 7.25 per hour ; a typical wage in many low - income countries might be more like $ 7.25 per day , or often much less ."	"0"
" Anti - dumping laws block imports that are sold below the cost of production by imposing tariffs that increase the price of these imports to reflect their cost of production ."	"1"
" Since dumping is not allowed under the rules of the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , nations that believe they are on the receiving end of dumped goods can file a complaint with the WTO ."	"0"
" 5237 . In general , high - income countries such as the United States , Canada , Japan , and the nations of the European Union have relatively strict environmental standards ."	"0"
" 5240 . One final reason why economists often treat the national interest argument skeptically is that almost any product can be touted by lobbyists and politicians as vital to national security ."	"0"
" In 1954 , the United States became worried that it was importing half of the wool required for military uniforms , so it declared wool and mohair to be “ strategic materials ” and began to give subsidies to wool and mohair farmers ."	"0"
" 5243 . There are different types of economic integration across the globe , ranging from free trade agreements , in which participants allow each other ’s imports without tariffs or quotas , to common markets , in which participants have a common external trade policy as well as free trade within the group , to full economic unions , in which , in addition to a common market , monetary and fiscal policies are coordinated ."

" 5261 . For example , points A and B sit on the same indifference curve Um , which means that they provide Lilly with the same level of utility ."	"0"
" Thus , the marginal utility that Lilly would gain from , say , increasing her consumption of books from two to three must be equal to the marginal utility that she would lose if her consumption of doughnuts was cut from 120 to 84—so that her overall utility remains unchanged between points A and B ."	"0"
" Indeed , the slope along an indifference curve is referred to as the marginal rate of substitution , which is the rate at which a person is willing to trade one good for another so that utility will remain the same ."	"1"
" If the price of a good that you have been buying falls , then in effect your buying power has risen — you are able to purchase more goods ."	"0"
" The price of a bond depends on the future payments that the bond is expected to make , including both payments of interest and the repayment of the face value of the bond ."	"0"
" 5273 . All sales of the final goods and services that make up GDP will eventually end up as income for workers , for managers , and for investors and owners of firms ."	"0"
" 5276 . The final ingredient of the Keynesian cross or expenditure - output diagram is the aggregate expenditure schedule , which will show the total expenditures in the economy for each level of real GDP ."	"1"
" The intersection of the aggregate expenditure line with the 45-degree line — at point E0 in [ link ] — will show the equilibrium for the economy , because it is the point where aggregate expenditure is equal to output or real GDP ."	"0"
" 5279 . ( Exactly how a situation of zero income and negative savings would work in practice is not important , because even low - income societies are not literally at zero income , so the point is hypothetical . )"	"0"
" 5282 . All the components of aggregate demand — consumption , investment , government spending , and the trade balance — are now in place to build the Keynesian cross diagram ."	"0"
" [ link ] builds up an aggregate expenditure function , based on the numerical illustrations of C , I , G , X , and M that have been used throughout this text ."	"0"
" 5285 . The meaning of “ equilibrium ” remains the same ; that is , equilibrium is a point of balance where no incentive exists to shift away from that outcome ."	"1"
" To understand why the point of intersection between the aggregate expenditure function and the 45-degree line is a macroeconomic equilibrium , consider what would happen if an economy found itself to the right of the equilibrium point E , say point H in [ link ] , where output is higher than the equilibrium ."

" This is called the multiplier effect : An initial increase in spending , cycles repeatedly through the economy and has a larger impact than the initial dollar amount spent ."	"1"
" In [ link ] , producer surplus is the area labeled G — that is , the area between the market price and the segment of the supply curve below the equilibrium ."	"0"
" In effect , the price floor causes the area H to be transferred from consumer to producer surplus , but also causes a deadweight loss of J + K ."	"0"
" In the first chapter , Smith introduces the division of labor , which means that the way a good or service is produced is divided into a number of tasks that are performed by different workers , instead of all the tasks being done by the same person ."	"1"
" 4324 . They analyze issues and problems with economic theories that are based on particular assumptions about human behavior , that are different than the assumptions an anthropologist or psychologist might use ."	"0"
" It pictures the economy as consisting of two groups — households and firms — that interact in two markets : the goods and services market in which firms sell and households buy and the labor market in which households sell labor to business firms or other employees ."	"1"
" The idea behind opportunity cost is that the cost of one item is the lost opportunity to do or consume something else ; in short , opportunity cost is the value of the next best alternative ."	"0"
" 4345 . Just as individuals can not have everything they want and must instead make choices , society as a whole can not have everything it might want , either ."	"0"
" 4348 . This pattern is common enough that it has been given a name : the law of diminishing returns , which holds that as additional increments of resources are added to a certain purpose , the marginal benefit from those additional increments will decline ."	"1"
" How to determine what a society desires can be a controversial question , and is usually discussed in political science , sociology , and philosophy classes as well as in economics ."	"0"
" As depicted in the budget constraint or the production possibilities frontier , it is necessary to give up some of one good to gain more of the other good ."	"0"
" An economist might say that people choose not to get a college degree because they may have to borrow money to go to college , and the interest they have to pay on that loan in the future will affect their decisions today ."	"0"
" 4363 . Price elasticity is the ratio between the percentage change in the quantity demanded ( Qd ) or supplied ( Qs ) and the corresponding percent change in price ."	"1"
" Demand was inelastic between points A and B and elastic between points G and H. This shows us that price elasticity of demand changes at different points along a straight - line demand curve ."	"0"
" 4372 . Zero elasticity or perfect inelasticity , as depicted in [ link ] refers to the extreme case in which a percentage change in price , no matter how large , results in zero change in quantity ."	"1"
" 4375 . The example of cigarette taxes showed that because demand is inelastic , taxes are not effective at reducing the equilibrium quantity of smoking , and they are mainly passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices ."	"0"
" The difference is important because even though a business pays income taxes based on its accounting profit , whether or not it is economically successful depends on its economic profit ."	"0"
" Since the total cost of producing 40 haircuts is $ 320 , the average total cost for producing each of 40 haircuts is $ 320/40 , or $ 8 per haircut ."	"0"
" 4402 . Finally , the right - hand portion of the long - run average cost curve , running from output level Q4 to Q5 , shows a situation where , as the level of output and the scale rises , average costs rise as well ."	"1"
" A firm or a factory can grow so large that it becomes very difficult to manage , resulting in unnecessarily high costs as many layers of management try to communicate with workers and with each other , and as failures to communicate lead to disruptions in the flow of work and materials ."	"0"
" A rise in price almost always leads to an increase in the quantity supplied of that good or service , while a fall in price will decrease the quantity supplied ."	"0"
" 4417 . The point where the supply curve ( S ) and the demand curve ( D ) cross , designated by point E in [ link ] , is called the equilibrium ."	"1"
" The equilibrium price is the only price where the plans of consumers and the plans of producers agree — that is , where the amount of the product consumers want to buy ( quantity demanded ) is equal to the amount producers want to sell ( quantity supplied ) . This common quantity is called the equilibrium quantity ."	"1"
" 4420 . When the price is below equilibrium , there is excess demand , or a shortage — that is , at the given price the quantity demanded , which has been stimulated by the lower price , now exceeds the quantity supplied , which had been depressed by the lower price ."	"1"
" It rose from 9.8 % in 1970 to 12.6 % in 2000 , and will be a projected ( by the U.S. Census Bureau ) 20 % of the population by 2030 ."	"0"
" Therefore , a shift in demand happens when a change in some economic factor ( other than price ) causes a different quantity to be demanded at every price ."	"0"

" A drought decreases the supply of agricultural products , which means that at any given price , a lower quantity will be supplied ; conversely , especially good weather would shift the supply curve to the right ."	"0"
" When a firm discovers a new technology that allows the firm to produce at a lower cost , the supply curve will shift to the right , as well ."	"0"
" 4435 . “ Well , it is clear that a drought reduces supply , so I will shift back the supply curve , as in the shift from the original supply curve S0 to S1 shown on the diagram ( called Shift 1 ) ."	"0"
" Then , a higher price makes farmers more likely to supply the good , so the supply curve shifts right , as shown by the shift from S1 to S2 , on the diagram ( shown as Shift 2 ) , so that the equilibrium now moves from E1 to E2 ."	"0"
" 4438 . The most common way price supports work is that the government enters the market and buys up the product , adding to demand to keep prices higher than they otherwise would be ."	"0"
" According to the Common Agricultural Policy reform passed in 2013 , the European Union ( EU ) will spend about 60 billion euros per year , or 67 billion dollars per year , or roughly 38 % of the EU budget , on price supports for Europe ’s farmers from 2014 to 2020 ."	"0"
" In the absence of government intervention , the price would adjust so that the quantity supplied would equal the quantity demanded at the equilibrium point E0 , with price P0 and quantity Q0 ."	"0"
" In a situation of excess supply in the labor market , with many applicants for every job opening , employers will have an incentive to offer lower wages than they otherwise would have ."	"0"
" Nurses ’ salary will move down toward equilibrium . In contrast , if the salary is below the equilibrium at , say , $ 60,000 per year , then a situation of excess demand or a shortage arises ."	"0"
" 4450 . Instead , each consumer reacts according to that person ’s preferences and budget set , and each profit - seeking producer reacts to the impact on its expected profits ."	"0"
" 4453 . To understand how a household will make its choices , economists look at what consumers can afford , as shown in a budget constraint line , and the total utility or satisfaction derived from those choices ."	"0"
" In a budget constraint line , the quantity of one good is measured on the horizontal axis and the quantity of the other good is measured on the vertical axis ."	"1"
" 4456 . The most common pattern of total utility , as shown here , is that consuming additional goods leads to greater total utility , but at a decreasing rate ."	"0"
" Since the price of T - shirts is twice as high as the price of movies , to maximize utility the last T - shirt chosen needs to provide exactly twice the marginal utility ( MU ) of the last movie ."	"0"
" Kimberly will again consider the utility and marginal utility that she receives from concert tickets and overnight getaways and seek her utility - maximizing choice on the new budget line ."	"0"
" The substitution effect occurs when a price changes and consumers have an incentive to consume less of the good with a relatively higher price and more of the good with a relatively lower price ."	"1"
" The income effect is that a higher price means , in effect , the buying power of income has been reduced ( even though actual income has not changed ) , which leads to buying less of the good ( when the good is normal ) ."	"1"
" The economic logic is precisely the same as in the case of a consumption choice budget constraint , but the labels are different on a labor - leisure budget constraint ."	"0"
" 4477 . Industries differ from one another in terms of how many sellers there are in a specific market , how easy or difficult it is for a new firm to enter , and the type of products that are sold ."	"1"
" If the farmer started out producing at a level of 60 , and then experimented with increasing production to 70 , marginal revenues from the increase in production would exceed marginal costs — and so profits would rise ."	"0"
" 4489 . For an increasing cost industry , as the market expands , the old and new firms experience increases in their costs of production , which makes the new zero - profit level intersect at a higher price than before ."	"1"
" A patent gives the inventor the exclusive legal right to make , use , or sell the invention for a limited time ; in the United States , exclusive patent rights last for 20 years ."	"1"
" The idea is to provide limited monopoly power so that innovative firms can recoup their investment in R&D , but then to allow other firms to produce the product more cheaply once the patent expires ."	"0"
" When a monopolist increases sales by one unit , it gains some marginal revenue from selling that extra unit , but also loses some marginal revenue because every other unit must now be sold at a lower price ."	"0"
" 4516 . Some intangible aspects may be promises like a guarantee of satisfaction or money back , a reputation for high quality , services like free delivery , or offering a loan to purchase the product ."	"0"
" For example , many people could not tell the difference in taste between common varieties of beer or cigarettes if they were blindfolded but , because of past habits and advertising , they have strong preferences for certain brands ."	"0"
" 4519 . Although the process by which a monopolistic competitor makes decisions about quantity and price is similar to the way in which a monopolist makes such decisions , two differences are worth remembering ."	"0"
" First , although both a monopolist and a monopolistic competitor face downward - sloping demand curves , the monopolist ’s perceived demand curve is the market demand curve , while the perceived demand curve for a monopolistic competitor is based on the extent of its product differentiation and how many competitors it faces ."	"0"
" Second , a monopolist is surrounded by barriers to entry and need not fear entry , but a monopolistic competitor who earns profits must expect the entry of firms with similar , but differentiated , products ."	"0"
" 4522 . Thus , although a monopolistically competitive firm may earn positive economic profits in the short term , the process of new entry will drive down economic profits to zero in the long run ."	"0"
" 4531 . The desire of businesses to avoid competing so that they can instead raise the prices that they charge and earn higher profits has been well understood by economists ."	"0"
" Adam Smith wrote in Wealth of Nations in 1776 : “ People of the same trade seldom meet together , even for merriment and diversion , but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public , or in some contrivance to raise prices . ”"	"0"
" 4534 . Each oligopolist , however , must worry that while it is holding down output , other firms are taking advantage of the high price by raising output and earning higher profits ."	"0"
" 4537 . One example of the pressure these firms can exert on one another is the kinked demand curve , in which competing oligopoly firms commit to match price cuts , but not price increases ."	"1"
" 4543 . In many cases , these large firms were organized in the legal form of a “ trust , ” in which a group of formerly independent firms were consolidated together by mergers and purchases , and a group of “ trustees ” then ran the companies as if they were a single firm ."	"1"
" In an early demonstration of the law ’s power , the U.S. Supreme Court in 1911 upheld the government ’s right to break up Standard Oil , which had controlled about 90 % of the country ’s oil refining , into 34 independent firms , including Exxon , Mobil , Amoco , and Chevron ."	"0"
" An early tool was the concentration ratio , which measures what share of the total sales in the industry are accounted for by the largest firms , typically the top four to eight firms ."	"1"
" Say that the market for replacing broken automobile windshields in a certain city has 18 firms with the market shares shown in [ link ] , where the market share is each firm ’s proportion of total sales in that market ."	"1"
" 4552 . Antitrust law includes rules against restrictive practices — practices that do not involve outright agreements to raise price or to reduce the quantity produced , but that might have the effect of reducing competition ."	"1"
" Antitrust cases involving restrictive practices are often controversial , because they delve into specific contracts or agreements between firms that are allowed in some cases but not in others . For example , if a product manufacturer is selling to a group of dealers who then sell to the general public it is illegal for the manufacturer to demand a minimum resale price maintenance agreement , which would require the dealers to sell for at least a certain minimum price ."

" 4558 . All sides agreed that the capabilities of computer software that was compatible with Windows — both software produced by Microsoft and that produced by other companies — had expanded dramatically in the 1990s ."	"0"
" Having a monopoly or a near - monopoly is not necessarily illegal in and of itself , but in cases where one company controls a great deal of the market , antitrust regulators look at any allegations of restrictive practices with special care ."	"0"
" Point C illustrates one tempting choice : the regulator requires that the firm produce the quantity of output where marginal cost crosses the demand curve at an output of 8 , and charge the price of 3.5 , which is equal to marginal cost at that point ."	"0"
" This rule is appealing because it requires price to be set equal to marginal cost , which is what would occur in a perfectly competitive market , and it would assure consumers a higher quantity and lower price than at the monopoly choice A ."	"0"
" The United States carried out a great policy experiment — the deregulation discussed in Monopoly — removing government controls over prices and quantities produced in airlines , railroads , trucking , intercity bus travel , natural gas , and bank interest rates ."	"1"

" Because externalities represent a case where markets no longer consider all social costs , but only some of them , economists commonly refer to externalities as an example of market failure ."	"0"
" When there is market failure , the private market fails to achieve efficient output , because either firms do not account for all costs incurred in the production of output and/or consumers do not account for all benefits obtained ( a positive externality ) ."	"1"

" 4594 . Depending on their different income levels and political preferences , countries are likely to make different choices about allocative efficiency — that is , the choice between economic output and environmental protection along the production possibility frontier ."	"1"
" However , all countries should prefer to make a choice that shows productive efficiency — that is , the choice is somewhere on the production possibility frontier rather than inside it ."	"0"
" 4600 . However , when a firm invests in new technology , the private benefits , or profits , that the firm receives are only a portion of the overall social benefits ."	"0"
" The social benefits of an innovation take into account the value of all the positive externalities of the new idea or product , whether enjoyed by other companies or society as a whole , as well as the private benefits received by the firm that developed the new technology ."	"1"

" 4921 . If firms across the economy face a situation where the price level of what they produce and sell is rising , but their costs of production are not rising , then the lure of higher profits will induce them to expand production . The slope of an AS curve changes from nearly flat at its far left to nearly vertical at its far right ."	"0"
" At the far left of the aggregate supply curve , the level of output in the economy is far below potential GDP , which is defined as the quantity that an economy can produce by fully employing its existing levels of labor , physical capital , and technology , in the context of its existing market and legal institutions ."

" 4960 . The Keynesian theory implied that during a recession inflationary pressures are low , but when the level of output is at or even pushing beyond potential GDP , the economy is at greater risk for inflation ."	"0"
" 4963 . Keynesian macroeconomics argues that the solution to a recession is expansionary fiscal policy , such as tax cuts to stimulate consumption and investment , or direct increases in government spending that would shift the aggregate demand curve to the right ."	"1"

" A national economy that does a fairly good job at achieving the four main economic goals of growth , low inflation , low unemployment , and a sustainable balance of trade will probably do just fine most of the time with any exchange rate policy ; conversely , no exchange rate policy is likely to save an economy that consistently fails at achieving these goals ."

" The experience of the past two centuries has suggested that the Anti - Federalists may have been correct in this regard ; while the states retain a great deal of importance , the scope and powers of the national government are much broader today than in 1787—likely beyond even the imaginings of the Federalists themselves . The struggle to have rights clearly delineated and the decision of the framers to omit a bill of rights nearly derailed the ratification process ."	"0"

" This means there has been a process of selective incorporation of the Bill of Rights into the practices of the states ; in other words , the Constitution effectively inserts parts of the Bill of Rights into state laws and constitutions , even though it does n’t do so explicitly ."	"0"
" For example , the courts have permitted religiously inspired blue laws that limit working hours or even shutter businesses on Sunday , the Christian day of rest , because by allowing people to practice their ( Christian ) faith , such rules may help ensure the “ health , safety , recreation , and general well - being ” of citizens ."

" Based in part on the federal RFRA , the Supreme Court agreed 5–4 with Green and Hobby Lobby ’s position and said that Hobby Lobby and other closely held businesses did not have to provide employees free access to emergency contraception or other birth control if doing so would violate the religious beliefs of the business ’ owners , because there were other less restrictive ways the government could ensure access to these services for Hobby Lobby ’s employees ( e.g. , paying for them directly ) ."

" In Schenck v.

" 6110 . Defining obscenity has been something of a challenge for the courts ; Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart famously said of obscenity , having watched pornography in the Supreme Court building , “ I know it when I see it . ”"	"0"
" Into the early twentieth century , written work was frequently banned as being obscene , including works by noted authors such as James Joyce and Henry Miller , although today it is rare for the courts to uphold obscenity charges for written material alone ."	"0"
" In 1973 , the Supreme Court established the Miller test for deciding whether something is obscene : “ ( a ) whether the average person , applying contemporary community standards , would find that the work , taken as a whole , appeals to the prurient interest , ( b ) whether the work depicts or describes , in a patently offensive way , sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law ; and ( c ) whether the work , taken as a whole , lacks serious literary , artistic , political , or scientific value . ”"	"1"
